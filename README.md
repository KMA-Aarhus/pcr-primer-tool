# PCR primer tool
IN DEVELOPMENT  

This workflow is created for the Department of Clinical Microbiology at Aarhus University Hospital to aid in monitoring of mutations in PCR primer sites. 

The end goal is a GUI allowing the user to:  

- Download species specific databases from NCBI  
- Perform local BLAST searches comparing query nucleotide sequences to the downloaded databases
- Produce overview tables for detection of mutations in primer sites
