# PCR primer tool
This tool is created for the Department of Clinical Microbiology at Aarhus University Hospital to aid in monitoring of mutations in PCR primer sites. 

There are two different workflows: One using an online blast on NCBI and another which performs a local blast search using a downloaded database.

The local search option allows detection of more than 5000 hits and is more user friendly.
However, if you require a very large database, use the online version.
